![Intro](./docs/intro.gif)

## 1. Install

First install it
```sh
    npm install locatorjs
```
or
```sh
    yarn locatorjs
```

## 2. Setup
### NextJS

add file `babel.config.js` to the root of your project.

```javascript
  module.exports = {
    presets: ["next/babel"],
    // enabled only on development
    plugins: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" ? ["locatorjs/dist"] : [],
  };
```

### Babel

add `"locatorjs"` plugin to your plugins in `babel.config.js`.

```javascript
  module.exports = {
    plugins: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" ? ["locatorjs/dist"] : [],
  };
```

### Create React App

for proper customisation you need to install https://github.com/gsoft-inc/craco.
Then add babel plugin in `craco.config.js`

```javascript
  module.exports = {
    babel: {
      plugins: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" ? ["locatorjs/dist"] : [],
    },
  }
```

### Ionic React

Ionic React is based on Create React App so for proper customisation you need to install https://github.com/gsoft-inc/craco.
Then add babel plugin in `craco.config.js`

```javascript
  module.exports = {
    babel: {
      plugins: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" ? ["locatorjs/dist"] : [],
    },
  }
```

## 3. Run 
 
Run your development environment. 

Each developer can setup their own IDE.

## 4. Tell others in your team

Because it will appear to everybody working on the project in development mode, don't forget to notify them so they are not confused with this new addition to their environment. 

Feel free to use and modify this template.

üëã Hey team, I have added LocatorJS to our repo. It is a tool that helps you quickly find any component in our codebase just by clicking on the component.

If it gets too annoying, click on "hide". You can then use it by holding option/alt.

Let me know about any problems. 

More info at https://github.com/infi-pc/locatorjs, you can give them a ‚≠êÔ∏è on GitHub if you like.
```

Each developer can setup their own IDE.

## Using
### Controls
- **Option/Alt+d:** Enable/disable selection
- **Press and hold Option/Alt**: Make boxes clickable on full surface (which can be more convinient than clicking on label)

### Disable LocatorJS on a single machine
if you need to disable LocatorJS on your machine, but don't want to change shared settings, add `LOCATORJS=disabled` to your cookies.

### Custom link
you can create custom links

#### available variables
- `filePath`: full path on your device
- `line`
- `column`
